## A game inspired in chess

*The Crown* is a chess-inspired board game in which two players battle for their Prince's crowning on a triangular board. Each opponent has six pieces, placed at a vertex of the triangle. The remaining vertex, which they will fight to conquer, is called the *crown* or *crowning box*.
