# Backlog

## Tree search efficiency (v2)

- Capture metrics of sample games in GAME_METRICS_FILE:
  - PLY1 vs PLY1
  - PLY1 vs PLY2
  - PLY2 vs PLY2
- Capture metrics of sample positions in MOVE_METRICS_FILE:
  - Positions from test_game_play_unittest.py
  - Report 
- Profiling of v1: bottlenecks?


## Game-play

### (v1)

- Define several playing styles.
  - Give Knight mobility a higher value.
  - Impatient Prince? (premature bonus for going up).
  - ...

- Allow starting game from some playing level/style.
  
- Extend quiescence search. Tactical moves:
  - Prince moves upwards (in absence of opponent's Knights)?
  - Soldier moves to throne (in absence of Prince)?
  
## Tree search (v1)

- Improve evaluation function:
  - End-game:
    - Prince distance to crown
    - Obstacles to crown?
  - Add small noise to leave nodes evaluation for diverse game.
  - Middle game: (v2)
    - Prince's safety? (e.g. soldiers and prince in kingdom)
    - Soldiers' structure??
  - Middle game situations depending on Knights' balance.
  - Encourage exchanging material when in advantage.

## Environment and versioning

- Enable vs code from CLI:
export PATH="$PATH:/Applications/Visual\ Studio\ Code.app/Contents/Resources/app/bin"

- Lock first full version (0.0.0?) with:
git tag v0.0.0
git push --tags

## Tree search efficiency (v2)

- Pre-evaluation of moves (extend make pseudo-move()?) for move sorting?
  - Static exchange evaluation?
- Add hash-tables for repetitions.
- Add killer-move heuristic? 
  - A single move
  - Extend to two moves?
- Add progressive depth search (based on hash tables).
- Try "soft-fail" alpha beta pruning?


## Optimizations (v2)

- Remove board3d field from Board class.
- Change board copying for make/turnback moves.
- position_attacked() with several return() points?
- generate_pseudo_moves based on 'beams' - 'shadows'.
- position_attacked() with itemgetter.


## Research (v3)
# ML agents.
- TBD

# Tree search optimization
-  Explore refutation of null move in quiesce():
    - Currently a node returns the best of:
      - null move (if possible).
      - all its dynamic moves (captures, checks, check-evasion, promotion/crowning)
    - This misses non-quiescent positions with huge threats (e.g. test_quiesce_01, test_quiesce_03).
    - The null_move could be corrected through opponent's refutations (in those refutation searches, null_move would be disabled).
    - If the refutation is sufficiently severe (e.g. â‰ˆ 1 Soldier), maybe the node is not quiet:
      a) explore defenses as "dynamic" moves in main search?
      b) full search one more level?
      c) Evaluate minJ(null_move, refutation value)? [Wrong: too pessimistice; it assumes captures and other threats are unavoidable!]
